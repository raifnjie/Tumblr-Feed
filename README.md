## Notes

Some challenges I faced durning this project was I guess Xcode with other applications running behind it can be a lot for a macbook so my macbook kept crashing and I had to keep restarting it. I also had trouble figuring out how to get my tumblr feed to actually show-At first it was only showing a solid white screen with not stories and then I was able to fix it.
